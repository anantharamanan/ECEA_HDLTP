I used same test bench which is used for week2.

Behavior Modeling:
In this modeling we will design the circuits based on it's behavior using truth table ,state diagram or state table

Gate Level Modeling:
In this modeling we will be designing the circuits based on gates , flip flops and registers

Data Flow Modeling:
Dataflow modeling makes use of the functions that define the working of the circuit instead of its gate structure.
